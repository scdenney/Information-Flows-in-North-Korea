Abstract:
>What determines the flow of unsanctioned information in authoritarian regimes? To answer this question, we explore the use and circulation of illicit foreign information among citizens in North Korea. This paper focuses on how the structure of social relations among citizens determines where and with whom people acquire and disseminate politically unsanctioned and potentially illegal content offline. Based on findings from a choice‚Äêbased conjoint administered to 313 former residents of North Korea, we show that social capital and trust-related effects associated with the place where information is acquired and the person who provides it determine information flows.
